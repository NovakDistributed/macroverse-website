                <p>
                    Macroverse is a procedurally generated universe, available to be used by blockchain-based games. Rather than paying expensive gas costs to store environment and level data on the blockchain, or spending large amounts of developer effort on custom world generation algorithms, game developers can use Macroverse as a piece of game development middleware, and can find settings for their games by exploring the single, shared Macroverse universe. Macroverse provides trusted, proven world generation algorithms, and a shared universe accessible to all developers, allowing even small developers to make big games.
                </p>
                <h2>Virtual Real Estate</h2>
                <p>
                    Players exploring the Macroverse world can discover, claim, and trade virtual real estate. If you find a particularly compelling star, planet, or geographical feature, you can claim it and make it yours. Ownership of real estate may confer beneficial effects or advantages in supported games.
                </p>
                <h2>Development Team</h2>
                <p>
                    Macroverse is being developed by Novak Distributed, a California-based software company. The lead developer on the Macroverse project is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-novak-607177133/">Adam Novak</a>.

                    Macroverse is generated by the <b>Macroverse Generator</b> (MG), a system of smart contracts on the Etherum blockchain. When on-chain game logic needs access to information about the game world, it queries the MG for that information. Queries to the MG can also be made by off-chain components of dapps and games, in order to display the game world on a user's local machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players can claim virtual real estate in the Macroverse world by recording their claims with the <b>Macroverse Registry</b>, a smart-contract-based ownership tracking system. Once claimed, players are free to transfer their real estate holders to other players, or even to custom smart contracts. Players own their virtual real estate outright, independent of any centralized entity or game company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first phase of Macroverse Generator development, code-named <b>Cannon</b>, has already been completed. The current Macroverse Generator supports the generation of an entire galaxy of distinct, well-characterized stars, suitable for use in large-scale exploration and strategy games. The current Macroverse Registry implementation allows these stars to be claimed by and transferred among players. On the backend, the Macroverse Generator uses novel smart contract technologies, including an advanced random number generator based on reverse Merkle trees and specialized for procedural content generation, and a novel fixed-point math library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Macroverse Star Generator is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain at address <code>0xc9650c155Bb268A1667B5F9c68701638cAE93d3f</code>. The Macroverse Star Registry is deployed at address <code>0x6C00556F471cbe518007D62bc4ACEd6d8e537c9D</code>.

                    <h1 class="display-3">The MRV Token</h1>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Access to the Macroverse Generator is enabled by an ERC20 token, MRV. A minimum balance in MRV must be held by any account wanting to query the Macroverse Generator, as a sort of software license. MRV tokens will also be put up as deposits by players claiming virtual real estate, to prevent players from claiming more than their fare share of the Macroverse world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>minimum balance requirement</b>, required to issue queries to the Macroverse Generator and use Macroverse-enabled dapps and games, is currently <b>100 MRV</b>. The <b>minimum deposit requirement</b>, which is locked up when a player claims a piece of virtual real estate, is currently <b>1000 MRV</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MRV token was distributed to players using a crowdsale, which ran from July 1st to September 27th, 2017. The total supply of the token was fixed by the crowdsale at 668,907.5704 MRV, of which 5,000 MRV are reserved by Novak Distributed. The MRV token is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain at address <code>0xAB6CF87a50F17d7F5E1FEaf81B6fE9FfBe8EBF84</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players and developers wishing to purchase MRV tokens can no longer do so through Novak Distributed, now that the crowdsale is over. Secondary markets where MRV might be available from third parties exist on <a href="https://etherdelta.com/#MRV-ETH">EtherDelta</a> and <a href="https://hitbtc.com/MRV-to-ETH">HitBTC</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that MRV tokens do not grant ownership of or voting rights in the Macroverse project. They do not entitle holders to future returns from the project. They are not a security. There are a number of risks involved in the Macroverse project, including without limitation security risks to the Macroverse smart contracts, the risk that Macroverse development will not be continued, and the risk that the Macroverse system will not operate as described here, any of which may prevent an owner of MRV tokens from actually using Macroverse. <strong>MRV purchasers assume all of these risks!</strong>
                </p>

                        <p>
                            In light of recent SEC guidance on token sales, Novak Distributed would like to reiterate that the Macroverse token (MRV) is not a security.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>MRV is not an investment product.</strong> The token is marketed to players who want to explore the Macroverse universe, and to developers who want to develop applications and games that use the Macroverse Generator. The token should not be purchased by would-be investors seeking a profit from the potential success of the Macroverse project. Money used to purchase MRV tokens is treated as software license sales revenue by Novak Distributed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Macroverse project is not a common enterprise.</strong> It is a project of Novak Distributed alone. Novak Distributed is undertaking the development of the Macroverse system independent of the sales performance of MRV tokens, and that development plan will not be meaningfully different depending on the number of MRV tokens sold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Purchasers of MRV have no reasonable expectation of profit.</strong> Software products, such as access to the Macroverse Generator, generally do not increase in value over time. Novak Distributed has wide lattitude in its management of the Macroverse Generator's access control system, and the Macroverse Registry's deposit system, and does <strong>not</strong> plan to use this authority to attempt to raise the resale value of MRV tokens. In fact, Novak Distributed desires to keep the resale value of MRV tokens low, and has the smart-contractual authority to produce and sell alternative means of access to the Macroverse Generator, if necessary, in order to do so. MRV tokens are transferrable to allow developers to transfer them to the users of their games, to allow players to transfer tokens that they no longer wish to use themselves to others, and to allow users to change their Ethereum addresses, not to allow MRV tokens to be resold for profit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similarly, virtual real estate in the Macroverse world, while it is not being offered for sale by Novak Distributed, is also not a security. With billions of star systems in the Macroverse world, the likelihood of being able to sell a piece of claimed real estate for a profit is extremely low. The virtual real estate system is designed to give players the satisfaction of ownership, not monetary gain.
